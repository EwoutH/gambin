# Overview

The gambin distribution is a sample distribution based on a stochastic model of
species abundances, and has been demonstrated to fit empirical data better than the
most commonly used species-abundance models (see @matthews2014gambin and @ugland2007modelling). Gambin is a stochastic
model which combines the gamma distribution with a binomial sampling method. To fit
the gambin distribution, the abundance data is first binned into octaves. The expected
abundance octave of a species is given by the number of successfull consecutive
Bernoulli trials with a given parameter $p$. The parameter $p$ of species is assumed to
distributed according to a gamma distribution. This approach can be viewed as linking
the gamma distribution with the probability of success in a binomial process with $x$
trials. Use the fitGambin function fit the gambin model to a vector of species
abundances, optionally using a subsample of the individuals. The package estimates the
alpha (shape) parameter with associated confidence intervals. Methods are provided for
plotting the results, and for calculating the likelihood of fits.

## Example

```{r}
library("gambin")
data(moths, package="gambin")
fit = fit_abundances(moths)
barplot(fit)
AIC(fit)
```
