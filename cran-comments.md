##This is a resubmission
I have deleted the maintainer field in the 
Description file so it does not clash with 
the AuthorsR field.

We have changed package maintainer from Michael Borregaard
to myself. Michael is still an author of the package
and gives his agreement to the change.

##Test environments
*local Windows 10 install, R 3.4.1
* linux-gnu, R version 3.3.3 (via Travis)
 
##R CMD check results
0 errors | 0 warnings | 0 notes


##No downstream dependencies
